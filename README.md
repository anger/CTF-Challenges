# CTF-Challenges

A Repository of some of the CTF Challenges I've made in the past, this is still a work in progress as I need to find the time to centralize them all here.

## Challenges
| Challenge Name | Category | Points | Description |
| -------------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Skip, skip, and away! | Pwn | 500 | Use undefined behavior in setjmp() and longjump() to defeat binary protections and execute shellcode|

note: This repo will not include challenges I've made for work, or private events.
