# CTF-Challenges

A Repository of some of the CTF Challenges I've made in the past, this is still a work in progress as I need to find the time to centralize them all here.

## Challenges
| Challenge Name | Category | Difficulty | Description |
| -------------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Skip, skip, and away! | Pwn | Hard| Use undefined behavior in setjmp() and longjump() to defeat binary protections and execute shellcode|
| Guessing Game | Pwn | Easy | Buffer overflow allows user to overwrite check|
| Pick Your Starter | Web| Med | Blind SSTI leads to RCE |
| Wing it | Rev | Easy | Simple reverse engineering challenge |
| Uh Oh! | Misc | Easy | A test of your knowledge in Regex | 
| secretclub | Web | Hard | Use hidden express functionality to bypass internal checks and allow XSS leading to permission manipulation | 


note: This repo will not include challenges I've made for work, or private events.
